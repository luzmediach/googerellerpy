# Googerteller in Python
This Python script uses scapy to sniff out packets your PC is sending to Google servers. It's a quick Python implementation of [Bert Hubert's Googerteller idea using his IP list](https://github.com/berthubert/googerteller).

It's using winsound, so if you're on Unix systems, replace with adequate non-blocking sound library.

# Run
Just run the script and Ctrl+C out.
